## History of Indian Music comprises of

Vedic Period
 : Music was deeply close to nature that’s why Vedas were created by Rishi Munis(Ancient Sages) who were inspired by Lord Bramha who is considered to be a creator of Universe. The existence of music in Vedic times is seen in the form of pictures of God and Goddess (Indian Mythology) which are shown either singing, dancing or playing music instruments.

Ancient Period
 : This is a period of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These two are considered as biggest epic stories, which have a long poetic narrative.  One example can be illustrated about Seeta’s Swayamwar. 

 : Whoever could wield the bow and string it, could marry Sita.  In this efforts, Lord Rama broke the bow creating a big sound in the universe.  Gods, Angels, Fairies became thrilled and started dancing; singing and the entire event became the spontaneous expression of joy.  This forms the first Orchestra of the Universe.

 : The Mahabharata’s whole Story revolves around Lord Krishna who is considered as a musical magician who used to entice animals, birds and humans together playing his flute.

Medieval Period
 : The distinctiveness of a singing style called as Gayaki, which was the reason why musical families with specific Gayaki’s were produced. Gayaki of a particular Gharana(Musical Family) involved how to produce good tonal voice, Expansion of Raga’s structure in the form of Alap, Classical Song and its beautification, tan and Bol-tan, Selection of Ragas and many more characteristics of their own.

 : These Gharanas still exists and wherein individual are trained fully with singing or playing instruments under Guru-Shishya (Master-Disciple) tradition that still exists in Modern Period. It is a tradition of learning through skilful & scholarly demonstration by Guru).

British Raj and Indian Music
 : It was the beginning of British Raj in India where Music became neglected, as they had no time for cultural activities in Indian Society.  Gradually the time came where Music started to have better days and it was slightly lifted up.  Two great people Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar and Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande, who formed the base of today’s music, had wandered and travelled all over the country to spread Music.  These two Pandits established many music schools in India, which were made open to common people who were formerly deprived of learning Music.

Modern Periods
 : By this time Indian Music was gaining popularity among British people too.  This was roughly about the same Period when a very different form of Music came into existence called as Ravindra Sangeet, which was created by Nobel Laureate Poet Rabindranath Tagore. After India’s Independence, Music developed in all directions to create new forms of Music. Communication became easier and Musicians across the borders started working together to explore more and more about World Music. it would be fair to say Music has become an indispensable part of our lives.
