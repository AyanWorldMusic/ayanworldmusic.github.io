Ever wanted your child to learn an Indian Instrument, to sing?

**New Classes for children starting soonâ€¦**

We believe that music can help your child achieve their full potential.

> In Our unique music session, we help children build confidence and explore the sounds around them through the world of music. Children engage in singing songs based on ragas and talas and get the opportunity to play instruments like Tabla, Harmonium, Dholak and Tanpura.  Not just that, we also explore music from around the world making it fun for childrens and parents from all nationalities.
